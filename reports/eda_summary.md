<h1> Explorative Data Analysis </h>

The observations are as follows -
1. Training data has no null values.
2. There are no un realistic value or outliers.
3. Data is balanced in nature, only imbalance found in column - "internet_access", 92% - yes and rest is no.
4. Numerical columns are very few, not that much information from correlation with output and matrix.
